    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure is designed to store conversion events triggered by user interactions, focusing on simplicity and scalability.  The structure prioritizes Authorization Independence, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control) principles.  All data is stored under the `/conversionEvents` collection.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** All users, including anonymous users, can write conversion events. There are no hierarchical authorization dependencies; all security rules are based on the authenticated user, which may be null for anonymous users.\n\n**QAPs Support:** Secure `list` operations are inherently supported because all documents in the `/conversionEvents` collection share the same security requirements. The rules will allow read access to any authenticated or unauthenticated user, making `list` operations straightforward and secure based on minimal restrictions. This approach prevents the need for complex filtering within security rules.\n\nThe schema is denormalized such that the relevant `eventType`, `eventTimestamp` and `eventParams` are stored directly within each document, ensuring each write operation is atomic."
